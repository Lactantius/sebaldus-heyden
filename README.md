# Sebaldus Heyden Dialogues

These are the dialogues that Sebaldus Heyden wrote for Latin students. I have formatted them in Markdown (Latin only) and XML (English and Latin, with macrons and notes), and written converters in [ConTeXt](https://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page) to produce PDFs that are ready to be printed as booklets. In the `editions` folder there are also three historical printed editions.

ConTeXt is fairly uncommon, so I intend to add more example PDFs in the future for those who just want to quickly print something off and not try to figure out a TeX variant.

For deciding which words should have notes, I mainly referenced [this list](https://dcc.dickinson.edu/latin-core-list1), and also added notes for unusual forms. I'm happy to hear any critiques of the macrons, the notes, or my translation.

If you like these dialogues, you can find many more [here](https://vivariumnovum.it/risorse-didattiche/propria-formazione/colloquia-scholastica).

Thank you to Justin Slocum Bailey for reintroducing these dialogues. His version can be found [here](http://indwellinglanguage.com/latin-media/latin-audio/heyden/).
